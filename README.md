# BiohazardProject
A simple experimental project used to learn / try everything I could have in my brain ...
For this project, my brain is focused on the Vulcan API (and only on vulkan, I don't have a multithread brain yet).

Why Biohazard ?

Probably because if you have the wrong idea of using even just a small variable of my code is at your own risk...


The beginning.
For now, I'm reading tutorials like this site https://vulkan-tutorial.com/, and sometimes, the Vulkan standard but it's boring.
Next soon...(maybe)
